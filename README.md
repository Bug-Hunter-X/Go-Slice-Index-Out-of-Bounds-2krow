This repository demonstrates a common error in Go: an index out of bounds error when working with slices. The `bug.go` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.go` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs due to an off-by-one error in the loop condition.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate over a slice, ensuring you always stay within the bounds of the slice.
